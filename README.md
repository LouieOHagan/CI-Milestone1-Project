This is a website for an organisation called 'My Furry Friend'. My Furry Friend is operational in 3 countries, Ireland, England and Sweden. Their vision is to create a friendly community of people who share the common love for dogs along with their goal to bring dogs and their owners from all around the country together to meet, play, walk and talk. The website will be used to provide information to visitors about the organisation in conjunction with dog accessories recommendations and multiple methods of contact.

The website has 4 main pages, "Home", "Walk With Us", "Our Favourites" and "Contact Us", each of which have 3 variants. As My Furry Friends is operational in 3 countries, the website will come with a dropdown bar to allow users to change their location and language, the website content will be updated retrospectively for ease of use.

- ### Design
    - #### Colour Scheme
        - The 2 colours I chose for the project was an #f7f7f7 (off-White) & #00a8ec (Light Blue). From the beginning of the design process,
        the goal was to design a very clean, simplistic but easy to navigate around website. #ec4400 (Orange) is a complementary to #00a8ec (Blue)
        however I decided to go with #f7f7f7 (off-White) as I strongly believe the two work really nice together and radiate cleanliness and simplicity.
        The Psychological effects that colours can have was a big part of deciding what colours to go with.
            - [#00a8ec](https://www.color-hex.com/color/00a8ec) (Light Blue): "Blue is the colour of the mind and is essentially soothing; it affects us 
            mentally, rather than the physical reaction we have to red. Strong blues will stimulate clear thought and lighter, soft blues will calm the mind 
            and aid concentration. Consequently it is serene and mentally calming. It is the colour of clear communication."
            - [#f7f7f7](https://www.colorhexa.com/f7f7f7) (off-White): "Just as black is total absorption, so white is total reflection. In effect, it reflects 
            the full force of the spectrum into our eyes. Thus it also creates barriers, but differently from black, and it is often a strain to look at. It 
            communicates, "Touch me not!" White is purity and, like black, uncompromising; it is clean, hygienic, and sterile."
    - #### Typography
        - The Titillium Web is the only font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the backup font in case for any reason
        the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Titillium Web was the only font used in order to maintain a simplistic look
        and keep it consistent throughout the whole site. The font was imported in to the style.css from Google Fonts who make it very easy to
        to import fonts and are a very reliable external source. The Titillium Web font offers 11 font weight styles from "Extra Light" (200 weight)
        to "Black" (900 weight) however for this project only the 300, 400 & 600 font weights were imported and utilised.
    - #### Imagery
        - Imagery was a big factor considered throughout the entirety of the development as it has such a powerful impact on users. All of the hero images
        were kept consistent in terms of style, all maintain the blurred background with a white dog to the right hand side of the image to keep with 
        the simplistic white page that was matched with a vibrant blue. I also focussed on obtaining images that best suited the specific page. Eg 
        "Walk With Us" contains a white dog on a walk & "Our Favourites" is a white dog playing with a toy.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

- #### First Time Visitor Goals
    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.
        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with Text and a "Learn More" Call to action button.
        2. As the hero image only takes up 60 viewport height the user will automatically be able to see the text "About Us" and "What We Do ?".
        3. The user has two thoughts in their mind, click the call to action button or scroll down, both of which will lead to the same place, to learn more about the organisation.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.
        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
        2. At the bottom of the first 3 pages there is a redirection call to action to ensure the user always has somewhere to go and doesn't feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page.
        3. On the Contact Us Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.
        1. Once the new visitor has read the About Us and What We Do text, they will notice the Why We are Loved So Much section.
        2. The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
        3. At the bottom of the Contact Us page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the organisation on social media which highlights the links to them. 

- #### Returning Visitor Goals
    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the different walking locations in my area that I could take part in.
        1. On the navigation bar that is on all pages throughout the project the user can click the "Walk With Us" link.
        2. They will be directed to a page with another hero image and call to action. If they choose to "Learn More", the page will scroll down to the walking locations that they can take part in.

    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.
        1. The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact Us" Page. 
        2. Here they can fill out the form on the page or are told that alternatively they can message the organisation on social media.
        3. The footer contains links to the organisations Facebook, Twitter and Instagram page as well as the organization's email.
        4. Whichever link they click, it will be open up in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.
        5. The email button is set up to automatically open up your email app and autofill there email address in the "To" section.

    3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the Facebook Group link so that I can join and interact with others in the community.
        1. The Facebook Page can be found at the footer of every page and will open a new tab for the user and more information can be found on the Facebook page.
        2. Alternatively, the user can scroll to the bottom of the Home page to find the Facebook Group redirect card and can easily join by clicking the "Join Now!" button which like any external link, will open in a new tab to ensure they can get back to the website easily.
        3. If the user is on the "Our Favourites" page they will also be greeted with a call to action button to invite the user to the Facebook group. The user is incentivized as they are told there is a weekly favourite product posted in the group.

- #### Frequent User Goals
    1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added favourite products recommendations.
        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the "Our Favourites" Link in the navigation bar to explore all products on the Our Favourites page.

    2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added Walking Locations in my area.
